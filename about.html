                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <div>I'm Disturbo! Or NotToDisturb, depending on whether the first one is taken or not. </div>
                    <div>I started playing VALORANT around the start of Episode 1 Act 1 (didn't make it to the Kingdom knife, RIP) and got into the lore part of the game in January 2021.</div>
                    <div>Ever since then lore has become something I love talking about almost daily, and it makes me very happy to be a part of this community.</div>
                    <h3>And what is Disturbo's corner?</h3>
                    <div>My way of contributing to the community! It's always a joy to give others tools to express their creativity, and I think these generators do just that.</div>
                    <div>Disturbo's corner won't be just that though. I want to make this a place to look for exciting takes on lore, discoveries in the game files, and more!</div>
                    <div>If you have suggestions for what I can add to the website, don't think twice and contact me.</div>
                    <h3>Contact you? But where?</h3>
                    <div>You've got a few choices. I'm mostly present on <a href="https://twitter.com/NotToDisturb">Twitter</a>, so feel free to drop a DM there.</div>
                    <div>I also try to upload to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NotToDisturb">YouTube channel</a> somewhat regularly (keyword "try"), and I also stream on <a href="https://twitch.tv/NotToDisturb">Twitch</a> from time to time!</div>
